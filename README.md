## README.md - yocto_on_rpi_B_2.0

**Purpose:**

To create a Yocto image for Raspberry Pi 1 and 2 that includes the necessary drivers to connect a Raspberry Pi v2.1 camera.

**Requirements:**

* A Yocto compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows)
* Yocto tools installed
* A Raspberry Pi 1 or 2
* A Raspberry Pi v2.1 camera

**Steps:**

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsrtgl/yocto_on_rpi_B_2.0/tree/master
```

2. **Setup Yocto:**

```bash
cd yocto_on_rpi_B_2.0
./Yocto/setup.sh
```

3. **Customize the Yocto image:**

* Edit the files in the `conf` directory to configure the desired build options and packages.
* Make sure to enable support for Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi v2.1 camera drivers.

4. **Build the Yocto image:**

```bash
./Yocto/build.sh
```

5. **Generate the image files:**

```bash
./Yocto/generate-image.sh
```

6. **Flash the image to the SD card:**

* Use an image writing tool to flash the generated image file to an SD card.
* Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi.

7. **Boot the Raspberry Pi:**

The Raspberry Pi should boot with the customized Yocto image. You should be able to connect the Raspberry Pi v2.1 camera and use it with compatible software applications.

**Note:**

* Please refer to the Yocto documentation for more details on configuring and building Yocto images.
* Additional steps may be required to configure and use the Raspberry Pi v2.1 camera, depending on the specific application you are using.
